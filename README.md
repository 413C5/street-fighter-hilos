# Street Fighter Hilos

This Java application demonstrates the use of threads by simulating combat between two fighters. Each fighter strives to achieve a combo score of 50 to secure victory. If both fighters reach a score of 50 simultaneously, the match ends in a tie. Moreover, the program displays console output within the application window, ensuring users receive real-time updates.

To start the simulation, simply click the "Iniciar pelea" button.
